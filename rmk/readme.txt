Set-up:
	No keybinds required.
	However, setting console to open on just ~ isn't a bad idea, as you'll be using it a lot.

How to play:
	In order to raise stats, you must open the console and type in the following:
		addstat 'stat' 'amount'
	Raising a stat by 1 requires 30 experience. 10 is rewarded everytime an enemy is killed (by you, squadmates don't count).
	If you would like to check your experience or a stat, type:
		checkstat 'stat'
	The stats are as follows:
		Agility - Increases Run Speed
		Dexterity - Increases Damage Given
		Endurance - Decreases Incoming Damage
		Vitality - Increases Health and Instantly Adds 20.
		Perception - Increases Accuracy.
		Luck - Increases Chance to:
			Gain More XP.
			Take No Damage.
			Deal Double Damage.
